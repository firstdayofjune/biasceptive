An arduino project to raise awareness of the gender data gap.

## Why?
Since the 1870s, women* had to fight for their right of birth control [(Gordon 2002)](#gordon_2002). Luckily, a lot has changed since then and women* can choose from a variety of contraceptives. This choice comes at a cost, though. Since the beginning of the 20th century, when women* became subject of scientific research through the developments of gynaecology and endocrinology, a gendering of contraceptives took place [(Klemm 2016)](#klemm_2016). As a consequence, the majority of contraceptives for women* emerged in the past century. In contrast, the research of contraceptives for men* stagnated [(Lloyd and Waterfield2016)](#lloyd_2016). This lead to a discrepancy in the contraceptive availability of 16:2, where 16 contraceptives are available for women* but only 2 for men* (with the vasectomy being one of it).

## What?
Following a Critical Making process (cf. [(Ratto 2011)](#ratto_2011)), we created a critical artifact we call _Verhütomat_ (Contraceptomat):

![Image of the Verhütomat](verhuetomat.jpg)

The _Verhütomat_ lists both female* (front) and male* (back) contraceptives. It uses two servos to indicate the currently selected contraceptives. In the inside, it is driven by an arduino board, connected to the servos and to a ultra sonic sensor. If the sensor detects a movement, the servos are started and will randomly show one contraceptive each (on one side for women* and for men* on the other side).
